# Google Meets Ping Backoff.
We all have that one friend or colleague who hasn't learnt the art of SHIFT+ENTER in order to make a multi-line chat message. Or even that individual who treats the Full Stop as a brain trigger to hit ENTER. 

Every enter makes PING. I a tiny background noise. So when the spamming comes in HOT! Your colleague is unknownly live mixing an annoying monotone DJ set in the ears of everyone in the same chat! 

Google Meets Ping Backoff extention is designed to help you selectively, by individual, reduce their latest audio master piece to just a single ping, within a selected period of time.
